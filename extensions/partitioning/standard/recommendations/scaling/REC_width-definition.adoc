^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/bbox/width-definition*
^|A |If the parameter `height` is present and the value of the `width` is not provided, the `width` should be calculated from the `bbox` and the `height` in a way that the cell size of the map is squared (w=h*(maxx-minx)/(maxy-miny)).
