openapi: 3.0.2
# Revisions:
# 2019-05-09 initial version
# 2019-05-11 added nullable values to support patch
# 2019-05-17 TileRow and TileCol are now 'numbers' (not strings)
# 2019-05-17 "unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`." has been removed and instead we have added "unless a different coordinate         reference system is specified by another parameter in the API."
# 2019-05-21 "The default Tiling Scheme is the Google Maps Tiling Scheme" is changed to "The default Tiling Scheme is the WebMercatorQuad (sometimes refered as Google Maps Tiling Scheme)"
# 2019-05-21 "CRSId" has been added
# 2019-07-11 Added keywords (there is tradition in using them)
# 2019-07-14 Updated with the last WFS3 draft https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/blob/master/core/openapi/bbox/ogcapi-features-1.yaml
# 2019-07-14 Replacins 'feature' by 'element' in many texts inherited from WFfS3 work
# 2019-07-24 Examples in Response collections and collection has been removed because the examples in the schemas create them automatically. Before removing them we have ensured consistency.
# 2019-07-24 Added attribution and crsSpatialExtent to collection.

      description: |-
        Only elements that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (elevation or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        The coordinate reference system of the values is WGS 84 longitude/latitude
        (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a different coordinate
        reference system is specified by another parameter in the API (e.g 'bbox-crs').

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

        If an element has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.

        Either a date-time or an interval, open or closed. Date and time expressions
        adhere to RFC 3339. Open intervals are expressed using double-dots.

        Examples:

        * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
        * A closed interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
        * Open intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

        Only elemenets that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
        `datetime` are selected.

        If a element has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

        generate an empty response container that indicates the count of the

        these two responses is generated is determined by the value of the
        optional resultType parameter.

        The allowed values for this parameter are "results" and "hits".

        If the value of the resultType parameter is set to "results", the server
        will generate a complete response document containing resources that

        will generate an empty response document containing no resource
        instances.

      description: |-
        Reusable object that contains an id to a resource and links where the object is described or a representation retrieved. Typically it is useful for paths like `\resources` and `\resources\{resourceId}`.   `\resources` will respond an array of id-link listing the `resourceId` and the links to get it. \collections and \collections\{collectionId} is an exception to this pattern.
        The fact that `links` is an array can be used to advertise the same object representation in different formats.

        The collections shared by this API.
        
        This response can be references directly for every service that wants only essential information at the collections level. /collections/collectionId might return more information.

        The dataset is organized as one or more collections. This resource
        provides information about and access to the collections.

        The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a link
        to other resources is present (e.g. the items in the collection; path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,
        link relation `items`) as well as key information about the collection.
        This information includes:

        * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;
        * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with axis order longitude/latitude);
        * An optional title and description for the collection;
        * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from the data;
        * An optional indicator about the type of elements in the collection (the default value, if the indicator is not provided, is 'feature').

        Information about the collection with id `collectionId`.
        This is an examples for commons only. A service should combine the schemas from common with others specific to its services. 

        The response might also contain a linkto the elements in the collection
        (e.g. path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,link relation `items`)
        as well as key information about the collection. This information includes:
