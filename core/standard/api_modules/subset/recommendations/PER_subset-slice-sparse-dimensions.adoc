^|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |*/per/coverage-subset/slice-sparse-dimension*
^|A |The empty portions in a coverage resulting from a slice operation on an axis (e.g. time), combined with a trimming operations on other axes (e.g. latitude and longitude)
 which would either be empty or not cover the full extent of the trim operation MAY be filled with data values from the same trim operation
 combined with a slicing operation on a different value of the slicing axis which would return non-empty values.
 For example, the closest or last previous time for which data is available for a certain geospatial extent may be returned.
 An Earth Observation use case for this permission is to allow retrieving a slice of the last available imagery on or before a certain date,
 taking into account that a certain geographic area may only be observed every few days.
^|B |This permission applies to both explicit slice operations using subset, as well as to implicit slicing from requesting an output format only supporting
 a lower dimensionality than the data (e.g. requesting a 2D image from a 3D coverage as PNG or GeoTIFF).
^|C |A query parameter defined by a custom or standardized extension MAY be made available to enable, disable or alter that behavior.
