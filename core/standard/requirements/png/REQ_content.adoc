^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/png/content*
^|A |Every 200-response of the server with the media type image/png SHALL be a PNG document representing only one tile
^|B |The colors of the PNG SHALL represent the geospatial features or coverage gradients in the tile.
^|C |The alpha channel of the PNG SHALL be used when partial transparency is required
^|D |All tiles representing parts of the same resource or resources and using the same style SHALL follow the same portrayal rules
|===

NOTE: The way the colors in the PNG are mapped to geospatial features or coverage gradients is out of scope of this standard. However a common set of portrayal rules for all tiles representing part of the same resource is essential, as adjacent tiles are normally represented one next to the other and presented as a single image to the user.
