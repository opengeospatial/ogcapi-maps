^|B |`mm-per-pixel` SHALL be a positive number indicating the size (in millimeters) of a rendering device pixel.
^|C |if the parameter `mm-per-pixel` is not provided, the server SHALL assume that the pixel size is 0.28 millimeters (90.71 pixels per inch).

NOTE: The definition of 0.28 as a default value is the same value as used in Web Map Service WMS 1.3.0 (OGC 06-042) and in the Symbology Encoding (SE) Implementation Specification 1.1.0 (OGC 05-077r4) that was later adopted by WMTS 1.0 (OGC 07-057r7) and 2D-TMS OGC (17-083r4). 0.28 mm Was the actual pixel size of a common display from 2005. This value is still being used as reference, even if current display devices are built with much smaller pixel sizes.

NOTE: Since the 1980s, the Microsoft Windows operating system has set its default standard display pixels per inch (PPI) to 96. This value results in an approximate value of 0.264 mm per pixel. The similarity of this value with the actual 0.28 mm adopted in this Standard can create some confusion.

NOTE: Modern display devices (screens) have pixels so small that operating systems allow for defining a presentation scale factor bigger than one (e.g. 150%). In these circumstances, the actual size of the device pixels is not the same as the size used by the operating system.
