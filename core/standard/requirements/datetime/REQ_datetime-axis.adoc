.A date-time (subset)
=================

`subset=datetime(%222018-02-12T23%3A20%3A52Z%22)`
=================

For resources with a temporal property that is a timestamp (like `lastUpdate`), a date-time value would match all resources where the temporal property is identical.

For resources with a temporal property that is a date or a time interval, a date-time value would match all resources where the timestamp is on that day or within the time interval.

.Intervals (subset)
