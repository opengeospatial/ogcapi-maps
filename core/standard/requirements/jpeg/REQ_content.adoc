^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/jpeg/content*
^|A |Every 200-response of the server with the media type image/jpeg SHALL be a JPEG document representing only one tile
^|B |The colors of the JPEG SHALL represent coverage gradients in the tile.
^|C |All tiles representing parts of the same resource or resources and using the same style SHALL follow the same portrayal rules
|===

NOTE: The way the colors in the JPEG are mapped to geospatial features or coverage gradients is out of scope of this standard. However a common set of portrayal rules for all tiles representing part of the same resource is essential, as adjacent tiles are normally represented one next to the other and presented as a single image to the user.

NOTE: JPEG is an ideal support for remote sensing imagery. The use of JPEG to represent linear features or color solid polygons is not recommended.
