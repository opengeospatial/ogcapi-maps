^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/link-relation-type*
^|A |If a legend is available for a style of the map, or for the default map resource, the server SHOULD advertise it in the list of styles (for each style element) or in the originating resource for the map (e.g., the landing page or collection description), by providing an extra link with a relation type `rel`=`http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/legend`.
^|B |There can be more than one legend for a style. If a legend is only appropriate for a range of scales, more than one legend link can be included with the optional extra properties `minScaleDenominator` and `maxScaleDenominator` specifying the range of valid scales. If only `maxScaleDenominator` is present the client will assume that this legend is appropriate for any scale denominators above the `maxScaleDenominator`. If only `minScaleDenominator` is present the client will assume that this legend is appropriate for any scale denominators below the `minScaleDenominator`.
^|C |If a thumbnail is available for a style of the map, the server SHOULD advertise it in the list of styles (for each style element) or in the originating resource for the map by providing an extra link with a relation type `rel`=`preview`.
^|D |If one or more style resources are available to apply the style to the map, the server SHOULD advertise them in the list of styles (for each style element) or in the originating resource for the map by providing extra links with a relation type `rel`=`stylesheet`.
