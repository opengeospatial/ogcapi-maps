^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/scaling/dimensions*
^|A |If only one of the `width` or `height` parameter is specified for a request, and no specific bounding box is requested (e.g., using the `subset` or `bbox` parameters defined in the Subsetting requirement class), the implementation SHOULD use the same value for the other dimension to return a square map image.
^|B |If neither `width` nor `height` parameter is specified for a request, and no specific bounding box is requested (e.g., using the `subset` or `bbox` parameters defined in the Subsetting requirement class), the implementation SHOULD select reasonable dimensions that will produce a map that is neither too small, nor require too much bandwidth to transfer or process (for example, around 1000 x 1000 pixels for the default 0.28mm/pixel resolution).
