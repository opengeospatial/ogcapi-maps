=== Introduction

The _OGC API - Maps_ standard defines building blocks which can be used in a Web API to retrieve geospatial data as maps that are visual portrayals of the data created by applying a style to the data (see <<rc_core>>). Maps can present the whole set of the geospatial data or only a part of it e.g. by filtering it by extent (see <<rc_spatial-subsetting>>). Maps can be retrieved by arbitrary extent or as tiles (see <<rc_tilesets>>)

Services and clients are encouraged to support as many of the CRSs as possible for all geospatial data resources to maximize
interoperability, but support is not required for any specific CRS.

This document does not specify any requirement for the type of _geospatial data resource_ that could be delivered as maps.
Provided that the geospatial data resources can be organized into maps, they can be supported regardless of whether they are features data, coverages, a resource that does not represent data per se (e.g., an annotation) and so forth.

NOTE: The geospatial data resources (e.g., collections) replace the concept of layer in WMS and WMTS. The main difference is that layers in WMS and WMTS were not defined by other OGC APIs and did not support other functionalities.

These geospatial data resources can advertise one or more map portrayals in several resources, such as the dataset (see <<rc_dataset-map>>) a collection (see <<rc_collection-map>>) or a collection with a style (see <<rc_styled-map>>). Other OGC APIs can provide other possibilities.

Accessing the _geospatial data resource_ content (other than as maps) or its descriptions is possible but out of the scope of this standard.
If a description of the _geospatial data resource_ is specified by another standard, and this description has a mechanism to add links to other resources, this standard indicates the need to add a link to the list of available maps.

The _OGC API - Maps_ Standard does not specify how to get a Web API definition, the conformance class list or the collections lists.
However, the standard assumes that the first two are defined by an OGC API standard (e.g., _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_) and the latter by an
OGC API for collections (e.g., _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_). A similar definition is provided directly by _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_.

=== Map interoperability

One of the most significant use cases for this standard API is to define a common way to generate maps on the web that can be combined together in a single view. In particular, provide a clear way to request an image that covers a particular bounding box in a map with a defined number of rows and columns. When this API is implemented by different organizations that offer different collections of information, the same bounding box, in the same CRS and the same number of rows and columns can be requested to each of them. The result is a set of images that perfectly overlap showing different variables of the same area depending on the collection requested. For example, a population map can be requested to one organization (e.g. SEDAC Population Density) and weather forecast to another (e.g. NDFD Surface Wind Velocity) using their APIs in the exact same way and both be presented together in one overlaid view or side by side.

=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards have historically implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using Extensible Markup Language (XML) for payloads. This was the state-of-the-art when some of the initial versions of OGC Web Services were originally designed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This architectural style has now a competing RESTful Web API style that is proposed as an alternative to RPC pattern. A RESTful Web API style is resource-oriented instead of service-oriented. The Web Map Service 1.3 did not described a resource oriented architectural style or an Web API definition. This OGC API - Maps standard specifies a Web API that follows the Web architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web as well as the W3C best practices for sharing Data on the Web.

This document provides the necessary elements to incorporate maps support to a Web API implementation. These elements can be incorporated in an API based on the OGC API - Features - Part 1, core or can be incorporated in a Web API implementation based on the OGC API - Common - Part 1, core. Both specify a kernel of a Web API approach to services that follows current resource-oriented architecture practices in the OGC. The OGC API - Common standard provides the foundation upon which implementations of the OGC APIs can be built. OGC API - Common can be combined with this standard and other resource-specific OGC API standards to build an OGC API implementation. However, this standard is done in a way that can extend OGC API - Common, but does not make OGC API - Common mandatory. This way, this standard can be reused as a building block in other APIs that do not follow the OGC API pattern.

Beside the general alignment with the architecture of the Web (e.g., consistency with HTTP/HTTPS, hypermedia controls), another goal for OGC API standards is modularization. This goal has several facets:

* Clear separation between Core requirements and more advanced capabilities. The draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core standard presents the requirements that are relevant for almost everyone who wants to share or use maps at a fine-grained level. Additional capabilities that several communities are using today will be specified as extensions to the Core API.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("requirements classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or Web API definition (such as new version of the OpenAPI description document).
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs will provide building blocks that can be reused in APIs in general. In other words, a server supporting the OGC API - Maps should not be seen as a standalone service. Rather it should be viewed as a collection of Web API building blocks that together implement OGC API - Maps capabilities. A corollary for this is that it should be possible to implement an API that simultaneously conforms to conformance classes from the Features, Coverages, Maps, Tiles, and other future OGC API standards.

This approach intends to support two types of client developers:

* Those that have never heard about the OGC. Developers should be able to create a client using the Web API definition without the need to adopt a specific OGC approach (they no longer need to read how to implement a GetCapabilities, allowing them to focus on the geospatial aspects).
* Those that want to write a "generic" client that can access OGC APIs. In other words, they are not specific to a particular API.

As a result of following a RESTful approach, OGC API implementations are not backwards compatible with OWS implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define OGC APIs in a way that an OGC API interface can be mapped to an OWS implementation (where appropriate). OGC APIs are intended to be simpler and more modern, but still an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations making the transition easy (e.g. by initially implementing facades in front of the current OWS services).

==== Correspondence between WMS map metadata and OGC APIs

In the WMS standard, the `GetCapabilities` response provide some metadata about the server and individual `layer` sections that inform the client on some layer characteristics and some restrictions useful to formulate a successful map query. In OGC API maps, the equivalent metadata is provided by the landing page, the list of collections, the collections details, the API definition, and the service-meta link from the landing page. Implementers of Web APIs are encouraged to make use of the mechanisms provided by other standards of the OGC API family to communicate the relevant metadata to the client.

The following table provides a reference to where some of metadata aspects at the service level are specified.

NOTE: The supported formats for map resources, or more precisely the media types of the supported encodings, can be also be determined from the API definition. The desired encoding is selected using HTTP content negotiation. In addition to the parameters specified by the core, other parameters should be added.

NOTE: The `cascaded` XML attribute in WMS is removed because no practical use has been seen in past

NOTE: The `opaque` XML attribute in WMS was rarely useful and has been removed. It indicated whether the map data represents features that probably do not completely fill space and shows the background opaque (true) or transparent(false).

NOTE: The `noSubsets` XML attribute in WMS was used to indicate lack of subsetting support. The client will know if the server is not able to generate subsets if there is no subset extension supported in the server.

NOTE: The `fixedWidth` XML attribute in WMS was used to indicate lack of scaling support. The client will know if the server is not able to generate different widths if there is no extension supported in the server describing the use of a width parameter.

NOTE: The `fixedHeight` XML attribute in WMS was used to indicate lack of scaling support. The client will know if the server is not able to generate different heights if there is no extension supported in the server describing the use of a height parameter.

NOTE: `x-OGC-limits.maps.maxWidth`, `x-OGC-limits.maps.maxHeight` and `x-OGC-limits.maps.maxPixels` are indented to control the work load of the server by providing limitations in size of the outputs of the subset. `width` and `height` parameters in the OGC API maps (defined in <<rc_scaling>>) control the size of the response and its resolution. The core of OGC API maps does not provide explicit limits but is free to respond an error to avoid server work overload. `width` and `height` parameters are commonly related with the size of the device screen; please consider that new devices are being build with more and more pixels and a past reasonable limit in the server size may become too restrictive with the emerging devices.

=== Relationship to other OGC API standards

The OGC WMS and WMTS share the concept of a map and the capability to create and distribute maps at a limited resolution and size.
In WMS, the number of rows and columns can be selected by the user within limits and in WMTS the number of rows and columns of the response is predefined in the tile matrix set.

The concept of a map used here is more abstract than the one used in WMS. A map is a portrayal of data resulting from applying a style (usually image formats such as PNG or JPEG format or in presentation formats such as SVG). The way the styling rules in a style are applied to the data to create the portrayal is our of scope of this standard (see the OGC API styles for details). A map can be delivered as a single resource or as an arbitrary extent. In addition a map can also be delivered as tiles by combining this OGC API with some requirements classes of the OGC API - Tiles. The relationship between the Maps and Tiles capabilities of OGC API - Maps and OGC API - Tiles was illustrated by the OGC Testbed-15 initiative as shown in <<img_CoreAndExtension>>.

This standard can be referenced by other standards providing resources that that can be offered as maps. For example:

* _OGC API - Tiles_ specifies the link relation types to access map tilesets from a dataset or collection.
* _OGC API - Styles_ defines paths to list available styles from which maps can also be accessed.
* _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows and Chaining_ provides a mechanism to trigger localized processing workflows as a result of retrieving maps (for a specific area and resolution of interest).

This document is the first part of a series of _OGC API - Maps_ "parts" that use the core and extensions model.
It is foreseen that future parts will specify other extensions, such as how to get information on a point in a map.
Other standards or extensions of standards may also provide mechanisms (e.g., additional query parameters) to deal with additional dimensions such as elevation, or more advanced temporal capabilities than what is defined in this standard's _datetime_ conformance class.

==== Dynamic and scalable map viewers
The concept of a map as an image was created more that 20 years ago as part of the OGC Web Map Service. At that time, the web was only 11 years old, most HTML pages were static and JavaScript was a rudimentary programing language capable of controlling user entries in an HTML form and not much more. In that environment, having a service capable of creating a PNG that could be embedded as a HTML page by using an IMG tag provide the first approach to static maps on the web.  Replacing the source (SRC) of the IMG tag programmatically with JavaScript, as a reaction of some user actions, provided the first approach to dynamic maps. GetFeatureInfo added a limited capability for queryable maps. However, users are now use to moving around the map by frequently doing zoom and pan operations. If the server is not providing a very fast response, the user experience is not fluid and the map is not responsive enough. One possible approach to solve this, is divide the viewport into tiles and request them separately. Since tiles follow a tile matrix pattern, they can be pre-rendered in the server or cached in the Internet. For implementing fast dynamic maps, this OGC API should be combined with the OGC API - Tiles.

==== Client side maps versus server side maps
This standard deals with maps that are generated by the server. The client can present them with no modification. Currently, even the smallest rendering device supports hardware rendering (a.k.a. the transformation from geometries to pixels can be done by the GPU). Transmitting geometries from the server commonly requires less bandwidth than transmitting the rendered map from the server and offers more flexibility in the client side to personalize the portrayal style. Because of this, it is expected that OGC API - Maps use cases will focus more on static maps as well as print cartography, whereas as OGC API - Tiles with raw data (e.g., Vector and Coverage Tiles) will be better suited for dynamic maps.

==== No equivalent to GetFeatureInfo as part of this document
The GetFeatureInfo operation in the OGC Web Map Service gives the capability to clients to implement some simple level of user interaction to the map. In essence the user will focus on a point in the map (e.g. by clicking on it) and the client will request the server some textual information related to the elements represented in that point of the map (a functionality sometimes called "query by location"). If the elements represented in the map are simple features, the result should be related to their properties (attributes). If the map represents a coverage, the result should report the value of the coverage in that position (eventually, if the coverage is multidimensional, it could be a e.g. time series graphic or a vertical profile). The format of the actual response is left to the discretion of the server.

GetFeatureInfo was proposed more that 20 years ago as part of the OGC Web Map Service. In that environment GetFeatureInfo provided an easy to implement solution for the first step to "queryable" maps. The second common expected functionality: querying or filtering by the attributes of the features shown in the map was never introduced in WMS.

The new OGC APIs emerges in a completely different context where most web content is dynamic and JavaScript is now a powerful programing language for the web. Most direct implementations of GetFeatureInfo result in an imperfect and old fashion presentations, and users demand much more than query by location. Now, the integration of the different API modules and building blocks in the OGC APIs is provided by default. A map is connected to a collection (or a dataset) that is most probably also offered as features with the OGC API - features or as coverage with the OGC API - coverages from the same API landing page. Furthermore, the OGC API - EDR also provides a point query, similar to GetFeatureInfo as well as much more advanced queries by polygons, trajectories or corridors.

In this new situation, implementers of map clients are encouraged to use OGC APIs beyond OGC API - maps to provide a functionality similar to GetFeatureInfo. Instead of building a request to a map point in map coordinates (I, J), implementers should use point narrow bounding boxes in CRS coordinates. For example:

  * In OGC API - Features, map coordinates should be transformed to long/lat WGS84 in the client side and implement a HTTP GET request to /collections/{collectionId}/items?bbox=lon,lat,lon,lat
  * In OGC API - Coverages, map coordinates should be transformed to native coordinates and use /collections/{collectionId}/coverage?bbox=x,y,x,y or the equivalent "subset" query.
  * In OGC API - EDR, map coordinates should be transformed to a CRS coordinates and use /collections/{collectionId}/position?coords=POINT(x y) or by adding a radius query /collections/{collectionId}/radius?coords=POINT(x y)&within=20&within-units=km

The use of OGC API - Tiles and serving vector tiles directly makes also possible to create visualizations with query capabilities directly in the client side. since vector tiles contain features, their attributes can be presented to the user when clicked and modifying the style applied to the clicked feature, this can be also highlighted.

NOTE: Even if this document does not provide a direct GetFeatureInfo equivalent, there is an strong tradition of GetFeatureInfo implementations that suggests a possible OGC API - Maps future "part" that can reintroduce a GetFeatureInfo equivalent if implementers still demand it.


=== Using this standard independently

Although this standard is designed as a building block that can be leveraged by other standards adding precisions about specific types of data available as maps
(e.g., _OGC API - Tiles_), the conformance classes defined in this document are still concrete enough to make it possible to distribute
and request map data by relying strictly on the content herein.

As informative guidance on how this can be achieved, implementations should consider the following aspects.

==== Description of the domain

Three different mechanisms are defined by this standard to describe the domain of the maps, including spatiotemporal axes as well as additional dimensions.

With the _Geospatial Data Map_ conformance class, the collection description inherited from _OGC API - Common - Part 2_ contains an `extent` property that can
describe both the spatial and temporal domain of the data. In addition, the _Unified Additional Dimensions_ common building block, used in the
example OpenAPI definition, further specifies that additional dimensions shall be described in a similar way to the temporal dimension.
An extra `grid` property in the example OpenAPI definition also allows to specify the resolution and the number of cells (for data organized as a regular grid) or
a list of coordinates (for data organized as an irregular grid) along each dimension.

The collection metadata allows to specify a spatial bounding box for maps as a whole, as well as for each individual
collections of geospatial data represented or contained within the map (the _layers_). The resolution of these layers can also be specified by including
the minimum and maximum cell size and equivalent scale denominators. The domainset can be enhancing the schema to include bounds and resolution for additional dimensions, also able to handle
the particularity of unequal temporal units.

==== Available formats and map response expectations

This standard defines five conformance classes for specific encodings to encode map data.
Additional encodings can be supported using HTTP content negotiation, following conventions specific to those encodings while falling back to the closest
encoding defined in these conformance classes (e.g., using the GeoTIFF as a model for other coverage data or the JPG and PNG classes
for other map encodings).

==== Limitations

Although this standard can be used by itself, other OGC API standards or draft specifications may provide additional capabilities and specify additional
normative requirements describing how to retrieve specific map content, or allowing to describe in greater detail the domain or the observed or
measured properties within the map data. Conforming to these standards as well may enable greater interoperability.

=== How to approach an OGC API
There are at least two ways to approach an OGC API.

* Read the landing page, look for links, follow them and discover new links until the desired resource is found
* Read a Web API definition document that will specify a list of paths and path templates to resources.

For the first approach, many resources in the Web API include links with _rel_ properties to know the reason and purpose for this relation. The following figure illustrates the resources as ellipses and the links as arrows with the link _rel_ as a label.

[#img_relMapTiles,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Resources and relations to them via links
image::images/relMapTiles.png[width=600,align="center"]

For the second approach, implementations should consider the <<rc_oas30>> which specifies the use of _operationID_ suffixes, providing a mechanism to associate API paths with the requirements class that they implement.

There is yet a third way to approach an OGC API that relies on assuming a set of predefined paths and path templates.
These predefined paths are used in many examples in this document and are presented together in <<table_resources>>.
It is expected that many implementations of this Standard will provide a Web API definition document (e.g. OpenAPI) using this set of predefined paths and path templates to get necessary resources directly.
All this could mislead the reader into getting the false impression that the predefined paths are enforced.
Therefore, building a client that is assuming a predefined set of paths is risky.
However, it is expected that many API implementations will actually follow the predefined set of paths and the client using this approach could be successful in many occasions.
Again, be aware that these paths are not required by this Standard.
