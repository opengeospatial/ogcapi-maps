        minScaleDenominador:
          type: number
          description: |-
            Minimum scale denominator (inclusive) for which it is appropriate to generate a map of this collection. Requests outside this interval will return an HTTP 404. If it is not present we will assume there is no limit.
          example: 10
        maxScaleDenominador:
          type: number
          description: |-
            Maximum scale denominator (inclusive) for which it is appropriate to generate a map of this collection. Requests outside this interval will return an HTTP 404 If it is not present we will assume there is no limit.
          example: 10000000
        #spatialResolution (resx) this should be part of the common metadata but currently is not.
        recomendedFormat:
          type: string
          description: |-
              Recommended output formats for a map request. Depending of the nature of the data, a format might be better than another. Categorical data looks better in a PNG but continuos data and pictures are smaller a JPEG. The map operation details all available formats for the OGC API maps. In contrast, this is the better one for this type of information. It would be one of the supported for the map operation
          example: 'image/jpeg'
        #queryable is not included here because it is indicated by a link with 'rel':'info' but I'm not sure it is the right decision.
        cascaded:
          type: number
          description: |-
            Indicates how main times the collection map has been retransmitted from another map service or API (cascading). It it is not present the collection is not cascaded.
          example: 0
          default: 0
        opaque:
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            Indicates whether the map data represents features that probably do not completely fill space shows the background opaque (true) or transparent(false).
          example: false
          default: false
        noSubsets:
          # this is a very old paramter in WMS and I recommend to deprecate it
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            Indicates whether the server can produce a map that is a subset of the full bounding box.
          example: false
        fixedWidth:
          # this is a very old paramter in WMS and I recommend to deprecate it
          type: number
          description: |-
            Indicates that the server can only produce map of a fixed width instead of an arbitrary width
        fixedHeight:
          # this is a very old paramter in WMS and I recommend to deprecate it
          type: number
          description: |-
            Indicates that the server can only produce map of a fixed height instead of an arbitrary height
