    OLD EXAMPLE NO LONGER MANTAINED!! OGC API Maps and Tiles OpenAPI document example
  description: |-
    This is a draft of an example (and imaginary instance) of a service following the OGC API maps and tiles produced in the Testbed-15 Open Portrayal Framework in collaboration with the WMS.SWG. The Map Tile API is a Web API for fetching and managing maps and tiles.

    The extensions are the following.
    * There are
    * The feature collection metadata (path `/collections/{collectionId}`) has been extended by the set of applicable styles (member `styles`, same
    value as in `/styles` in the Style API) and a default style
    (member `defaultStyle`, the style id).
    * The PATCH operation on the feature collection metadata
    (path `/collections/{collectionId}`) has been added. Only `styles` and
    `defaultStyle` may be updated.
    * The queryables resource (path `/collections/{collectionId}/queryables`)
    has been added to support clients like visual style editors to construct
    expressions for selection criteria in queries on features in the collection.

    For more background information see [the Vector Tiles Pilot Extension Engineering
    Report](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Map-Tiles/tree/master/standard/openapi).

        update parts of the style metadata
      description: |-
        IMPORTANT: This operation is defined by Clemens P. in the Testbed 15. It is included here for INFORMATION ONLY But is OUT OF SCOPE for Maps and Tiles.

        Update selected elements of the metadata for
        the collection with the id `collectionId`.

        The only members that may be updated at this
        time are `styles` and `defaultStyle`.

        The PATCH semantics in this operation are defined by
        RFC 7396 (JSON Merge Patch). From the specification:

        _"A JSON merge patch document describes changes to be
        made to a target JSON document using a syntax that
        closely mimics the document being modified. Recipients
        of a merge patch document determine the exact set of
        changes being requested by comparing the content of
        the provided patch against the current content of the
        target document. If the provided merge patch contains
        members that do not appear within the target, those
        members are added. If the target does contain the
        member, the value is replaced. Null values in the
        merge patch are given special meaning to indicate
        the removal of existing values in the target."_

        Some examples:

        To add or update the default style, just send

        ```
        {
          "defaultStyle": "night"
        }
        ```

        To remove the default style, send

        ```
        {
          "defaultStyle": null
        }
        ```

        For arrays the complete array needs to be sent. I.e., to
        update the list of styles, send the complete new array value.

        To remove all styles, send

        ```
        {
          "styles": null
        }
        ```

        This operation is only available to registered
        users.
