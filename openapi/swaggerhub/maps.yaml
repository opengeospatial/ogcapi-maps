  title: Map data service example. Part of the OGC API Maps and Tiles OpenAPI work.
  description: |-
    Maps of more than one collection.
    This is a draft of an example of a service following the OGC API maps and tiles that produces maps.

    It is elaborated in the Testbed-15 Open Portrayal Framework in collaboration with the WMS.SWG. The Map Tile API is a Web API for fetching and managing maps and tiles.

    It illustrated how to request a map from one or more than one collections

            This response can be references directly for every service that wants only essential information at the collections level. /collections/collectionId might return more information.

            The dataset is organized as one or more collections. This resource provides information about and how to access the collections.

            The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a link
            to other resources present (e.g. the items in the collection, path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,
            link relation `items`, a map created with data from  collection, path `/collections/{collectionId}/map`,
            link relation `map`) as well as key information about the collection.
            This information includes, but is not limited to:

            * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;
            * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS84 with axis order longitude/latitude);
            * An optional title and description for the collection;
            * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from the data;

          adhere to RFC 3339. Open intervals are expressed using double-dots.

          Examples:

          * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
          * A closed interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
          * Open intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

          Only elemenets that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
          `datetime` are selected.

          If a element has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
          server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
          the extent or all relevant temporal properties.
