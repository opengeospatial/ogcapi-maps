[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC has started a focused effort to extend their service standards into the Resource Oriented Architecture world. As part of this effort, this standard defines an API for Map Tiles.

The Map Tile API described in this standard builds on the Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) OGC standard.  WMTS provides a scalable, high performance services for web based distribution of cartographic maps. WMTS, in turn, complements earlier efforts to develop services for the web based distribution of cartographic maps. In particular, it compliments the OGC Web Map Service (WMS). WMS focuses on rendering custom maps and is an ideal solution for dynamic data or custom styled maps (combined with the OGC Style Layer Descriptor (SLD) standard). WMTS trades the flexibility of custom map rendering for the scalability possible by serving of static data (base maps) where the bounding box and scales have been constrained to discrete tiles. Note that an API version of WMS is also under development.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This document defines an OGC standard for a Web Map Tile API standard. A Map Tile enabled API can serve map tiles of spatially referenced data using tile images with predefined content, extent, and resolution. Suggested additions, changes and comments on this standard are welcome and encouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted using the online change request form on OGC web site: http://portal.opengeospatial.org/public_ogc/change_request.php
